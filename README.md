Using pyautogui and mediapipe, I created a hand tracking software which can be used to control your mouse.

The cursor moves on the screen as long as the tip of the index finger and thumb are touching each other.

To left click -> Middle Finger Tip + Thumb
To right click -> Ring Finger Tip + Thumb


TODO: Add scrollwheel functionality
